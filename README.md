## Pub Subs

## Scope:

I'm planning on building a sandwich ordering app. The name of the app is going to be Pub Subs. I think I'll reasonably be able to implement a full site linked to a populated database, that will have full CRUD abilities. I would like for the site to be complete to the point where someone would put in their payment information to pay for their sandwiches.

## Technologies:

React
<br>Ruby on Rails
<br>Axios
<br>FontAwesome
<br>CORS
<br>react-router-dom
<br>JSON web Token
<br>Bcrypt

## User Stories:

The user of this site is someone looking for a delicious sandwich, wether it be for lunch dinner, or for a party. They know and love the Pub Sub already and now just want quick access to ordering their very own flavorful masterpiece.
